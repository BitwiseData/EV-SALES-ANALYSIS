Electric Vehicle Sales Drop
## Project Overview:
This SQL project, a part of bluetick.ai, aims to uncover the reasons behind the sudden sales drop of Zoom Electric's Sprint electric scooters. The analysis seeks to understand the decline in sales for the newly launched Sprint scooter model and identify potential influencing factors.

## Problem Statement:
Zoom Electric witnessed impressive sales in the initial two weeks of launching the Sprint scooter in the electric two-wheeler segment. However, sales unexpectedly plummeted afterward. The project's objective is to analyze data and determine possible reasons for this decline.

## Approach:
The analysis is conducted in two phases:

## Quantifying the sales drop: 
Calculating the decline in sales volume over a rolling 7-day period to validate the drop.
Comparing sales growth: Evaluating if there is a relationship between the launch date and sales growth in the first two to three weeks.
Email analysis: Assessing the impact of the email campaign on customer engagement and overall success.

## SQL Codes:
The project incorporates various SQL codes for different analyses, including:

Growth Analysis for Sprint Scooters
Growth Analysis for Sprint Limited Edition Scooters
Joining Sales and Products Table
Summary Table for CTR and Opening Rate for Sprint Scooters
Joining Emails, Email_Subject, and Sales Table

## Conclusion:
By analyzing the data and understanding potential reasons for the sales drop, this project aims to provide insights to enhance sales strategies and optimize the performance of Zoom Electric's products.

## Findings of the Electric Vehicle Sales Analysis:
Initial Sales Surge: The Zoom Electric's Sprint scooter model witnessed remarkable sales during the first two weeks after its launch.
Sudden Sales Decline: However, there was an unexpected decline in sales after the initial two weeks, resulting in a ~20% drop.
Impact of Launch Date: Comparing sales growth with other scooter models indicated that launching Sprint in the second half of the year might have affected sales.
